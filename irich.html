<p>Greetings from the top. I don't own a private jet, but unlike many people in the world, I'm a potential actor in a world where private jets occur. In other words, being super rich is a real possibility for me, just like being a top player in, say, Angry Birds would be.</p>

<p>I could've worked hard and I could be on my way to even more money. I own a MacBook and I live in a nice apartment, and I'm safe and not hungry, never. Having my own jet would be merely an upgrade on my current situation; more of the same, that is.</p> 

<p>This is why my art lacks agency. Well, everything I do lacks agency. My social media feeds are full of pictures of me killing time and consuming my money in various ways: eating, traveling, playing, hobbying, cocooing. I know what that last word means. That's luxury, too. I'm educated and in the know. But I have no use for my knowledge. It's just another thing I've acquired, out of anything better to do. Everything is a hobby to me, even life itself. I have zero struggle. </p>

<p>I live in a country I was born into. I'm completely healthy and able bodied and of sound mind. There's nothing marginal about my identity, at least not in a way that would single me out or cause distress to me. Everything is and has always been easy to me.</p>

It's no wonder social media seems pointless to people like me. What could we possibly have to say? Especially since for the last hundreds of years, people in my position have dominated everything. I am history. I am philosophy. I am science. I am art. I am stand-up.

People who are unlike me, people who are marginalized, want to study and build on the things "I" have created. A rich man having no responsibilities, and nothing else to do but to think about his existence; these are the men, from Ancient Greek to contemporary thought, whose ideas you study in school.

Why do you care about me? The answer to this falsely naive question, of course, is that you can not afford not to care about me. Whereas "I" can afford not to care about you.
