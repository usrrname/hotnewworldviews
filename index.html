                    <p class="col lead" style="text-indent:5%;">Greetings from Below. We made Nordic names to
                        appear more
                        white, more
                        assimilated, more stylized like IKEA furniture tags. it was only natural this would be the
                        next
                        step
                        to fame and excellence. We were tired of the powerlessness of creating, then critiquing
                        culture.
                        Artists might as well be artisans or court jesters, or even better, digital prophets and
                        trend
                        forecasters. We needed a change of life Style, and this would be activated by an inaugural
                        Scandinavian name change. Race and ethnicity are social construct anyway. It's the thought
                        that
                        counts. <strong>Even society is a social construct!</strong></p>

                    <p class="col lead">Intellectuals call what we have "social capital", but we know, at best, it's
                        just a
                        fine
                        balance
                        of
                        showmanship and passion. Realizing we were failures at climbing the social ladder, we stayed
                        up
                        late
                        reading guides on how to become dismissive and charming, high functioning sociopaths. We
                        gave
                        each
                        other papercuts, stole from stores, lied and cheated to our loved ones and talked shit about
                        our
                        enemies. We knew whatever we were doing was going to be a drop in the ocean. Phrased the
                        right
                        way,
                        anything can be easily painted as a disaster. And there's tons of money to be made from
                        disaster.
                        This was is just one of a million emergencies–the quest for productive mediocrity. We are
                        Russian
                        metro dogs on the run, sniffing our way through the city, while taller humans look on with
                        disgust
                        and amusement. Disgruntled and powerless young folk turn into old men yelling at clouds.</p>

                    <p class="col lead my-6">This is what we know: if someone wants to work with you, they'll be
                        active. You can
                        smell forced
                        socializing from miles away. Meeting people is meaningless if there's no real desire from either
                        party.
                        Not that you couldn't get surprised by humans, in good and bad. And if you encounter the latter,
                        maybe
                        warn your closest friends? Yes, of course. But only if you know what you're saying. Keep your
                        gossip-to-info ratio in check. Colloquial tittle-tattle may be empowering, or entertaining at
                        the
                        very
                        least. You may think you have have dirty secrets, or you may have no secrets, but you want to
                        keep
                        your
                        professional enigma flowing.If you find the energy to meet whoever thinks you're important
                        enough to
                        meet them, don't be generic, pleasant, or nice. Remember: <em>Mediocrity is unmemorable.</em>

                    <p class="col lead my-4"> A creative career is a minefield of moving targets. Rarely we do things
                        for a
                        good
                        reason, but
                        many
                        are
                        the
                        times when we exercise obedience at the altar of conventions. Starry-eyed under a bleak, mute
                        Nordic
                        sky,
                        waiting for rain when the forecast has been dead set on a permanent dry season for you and your
                        peers.
                        But
                        another sun rises and we go to work or try to find it, and we stick to the ideals picked up from
                        MIT
                        books
                        when we were 19. No matter how hard it is to stay awake, cut dairy, pay rent and buy local,
                        creativity
                        always presents itself as a career, a hobby, an unwritten novel. Perhaps a casual Sunday
                        afternoon
                        in
                        the
                        woodshop instead of low budget flights to self-funded art fair booths where no one comes to buy
                        your
                        product. There are no missed chances, there are only more new opportunities. It's Creativity:
                        you're
                        living
                        it!</p>

                        meaningful
                        anymore.
                        Are
                        there unique emotions? Are there authentic experiences that don't require reflection? Am I too
                        easily
                        amused? Am I easily offended? Why be angry? Why suffer out loud? Is anything worth announcing?
                        Why
                        live
                        publicly? Will opting out help? Why quit Facebook when the thrill of friendship and belonging
                        will
                        ultimately rope me back?

                                </a>
                                became
                                a
                                certified hater in 2016. She tries her best to adapt to social moors of neurotypical
                                capitalism. Her Myers Briggs type shifted from INTP to INTJ in a matter of 3 years.
                                She
                                is
                                likely to give you a good reason for hating anything you bring up. Jens puts her
                                commitments
                                front and center. Leadership, leadership, leadership. There's no (time for) "you" on
                                her
                                team. She's quite capable of charming you but most days she lacks the serotonin to
                                self
                                motivate for teamplay. It's not because she is contrarian. Her vices are naps,
                                nicotine
                                gum,
                                and correcting punctuation and grammar. She considers none of the above to be
                                weaknesses,
                                but rather cut-and-dry lifestyle decisions that have defined her current success.
