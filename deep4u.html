<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">"I should rap about art history's irrelevance", I thought back in March 2013, while grumbling to&nbsp;</span><a href="http://jennifer-chan.com/"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Jennifer Chan</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;"> about academic art or something on FB&nbsp;chat.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Although I must admit my love towards Mount Olympus and the challenge its arcane forms provide us with, I'm still left&nbsp;unconvinced that an artist should be able to contextualize&nbsp;oneself. I'm not kidding! My fave art is the kind of which delineation is impossible to perceive (lol is that even English anymore). </span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">I dream of works that are like water and u know how water is, right?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">As you can see from the pic above, within an hour from coming up with this simple idea, I was lucky enough to get together the dream team for the job. I chose&nbsp;"I'll Be Missing You" as our song. It defined my childhood. It gave me an understanding, albeit confusing one, of what sadness and longing mean, and what afterlife is about.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Additionally, IBMY challenged me to view sampling and music-making differently, at the ripe age of 16</span><span style="background-color:#FF8C00;">.&nbsp;I realized that hit songs -and later, art works- are platforms for self-expression, instead of altars for passive worship.</span>
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shawnemichaelainholloway.com/"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Shawné Michaelain Holloway</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;"> and </span><a href="http://georgesjacotey.tumblr.com/"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Georges Jacotey</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;"> took care of delivering the vocals, and giving the original lyrics&nbsp;a makeover. I sent them brief notes in the form of a silly-but-serious pdf which you can spot&nbsp;in the end of the video, telling them that it'd be nice if the lyrics would deal with art history &amp; love life. Jennifer would then edit the video and I would take care of directing and sound. The background track was based on a IBMY&nbsp;midi version&nbsp;<a href="http://midi.homemusician.net/p/puff_daddy/ill_be_missing_you.html">I happened to find online</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Why do a video for the cover, why do any of it? Maybe I was&nbsp;unconsciously&nbsp;ripping off </span><a href="http://dismagazine.com/disco/video/62191/darlings-room/"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Jesse Darling's&nbsp;Drake cover</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">, in which I featured in. Or maybe I was dreaming of being a member of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8F-JuFM-K0&amp;list=PLkY5rkXxIWkQe0UzWCI5vcrcyki10bwRw"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Disband</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">, my favorite ever performance-music group. I don't know, it just happened on a whim. Previously, </span><span style="background-color:#FFD700;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y3OxDedHHQ">I've done a cover of a Notorious BIG<u>'s "Hypnotize"</u></a>(I was tremendously&nbsp;happy with it btw)</span><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">&nbsp;with </span><span style="background-color:#FFD700;"><a href="http://jennimarkkanen.com/">Jenni Markkanen</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Money was a also a factor this time around. In Jan-Oct 2014, I've been living off of a grant I received from </span><a href="http://www.koneensaatio.fi/"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Kone Foundation</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">, a private Finnish foundation supporting art and sciences bent towards the experimental. With that money, I was (more) able to compensate at least something to everyone for&nbsp;their time,&nbsp;and more generally to arrange these projects where I act as the convener/director.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">When people send me their input it always feels like Christmas. I aim to work with people who I trust, so I can have them join in&nbsp;to do whatever they want. This way,&nbsp;you learn to accept new things &amp; aesthetics, ones you didn't even know you could one day be into.</span></p>


<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Maybe my love for the scenery over a particular image is something I've learned from curating stuff like </span><a href="http://lolnoei.tumblr.com/"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Antagon</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">. I like to call my exhibition- and event-making activities "producing" or "directing", instead of the c-word, though. I rarely have a particular vision or an inquiry of sorts in mind when I put together projects —I've rarely worked with themes, for example. Usually I have people and a space in mind, and an&nbsp;energy I'm after &amp; I'm suspecting these people might also be going for. That was the case here, too.</span></p>


<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">I think both Georges'&nbsp;and Shawné's delivery on the video depicts the characteristics of their respective styles. With this I mean works like&nbsp;Shawné's&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.xtube.com/watch.php?v=5gNZ0-S373-#.U999uJS297o"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">"a&nbsp;personal project"</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">&nbsp;(NSFW video)&nbsp;and </span><a href="http://www.shawnemichaelainholloway.com/toolboxes/SSSad.zip"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">sorry i'm sad all the time #22 (2013-14)</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">&nbsp;(.zip file), or Georges'&nbsp;</span><a href="http://sonofapatriarch.com/"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Son Of a Patriarch</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;"> (a project/web site/performances)&nbsp;and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGxkc4b6p94"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">this musical performance documentation</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Together they gave this&nbsp;song a living body.&nbsp;Georges did those shots of his legs, the city of Athens, and himself feelin' it feelin' it feelin' it. Shawné had already added some reverb to her vocal tracks and a real sense of space when I received her files. It figured that Jennifer edited&nbsp;her flying around in the video, like she's an unsettled love letter transmitted by wind from Chicago&nbsp;to Athens.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Georges I have met and worked together before (and are planning to do so soon again).&nbsp;Shawné was in Finland for a residency earlier this year (or sometime late 2013 - early 2014), and I met her for a drink in Helsinki, while being super scared whether I was boring her with my stock lecture on Finnish art funding (good news everyone, I've removed that act from my repertoire). I've never met Jennifer IRL, only had these life-affirming chat sessions with her online.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">I'm glad that Jennifer decided to&nbsp;edit Deep 4 U,&nbsp;which meant sourcing all the visual materials other than the ones shot by Shawné and Georges themselves and a few pic I sent her,&nbsp;since it feels like a continuation of something that took place over two (?) years ago. She did an </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/53496078"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">uncanny cover</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;"> of my video "</span><a href="https://vimeo.com/52881122"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Express Yourself</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">". The result was like a psychedelic music video from a world where choruses never happened. Needless to say I love Jennifer's work and admire her style (like in her "</span><a href="https://vimeo.com/56924770"><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">[[[&nbsp;I'll Show You HD video</span></a><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">&nbsp;]]]"), which is easy to spot even on Deep&nbsp;4 U.</span></p>


<p><span style="background-color:#FFD700;">Lastly, I added bits of&nbsp;my own voice to the song (intro and credits). I kept my parts muddy and distorted, like it's noise for noise's sake, which is a feeling I usually have towards the stuff I do. But even then I always believe that maybe something something something comes out, gets revealed, sees the sun, if I just let myself go. This time around, I had the pleasure of witnessing three artists I love doing just that, I think.</span></p>
