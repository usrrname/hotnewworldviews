    <p class = leader>
    Greetings from the top. I don't own a private jet, but unlike many people in the world, I'm a potential actor in a world where private jets occur. In other words, being super rich is a real possibility for me, just like being a top player in, say, Angry Birds would be.
    I could've worked hard and I could be on my way to even more money. I own a MacBook and I live in a nice apartment, and I'm safe and not hungry, never. Having my own jet would be merely an upgrade on my current situation; more of the same, that is.</p>

    <p class = "leader">This is why my art lacks agency. Well, everything I do lacks agency. My social media feeds are full of pictures of me killing time and consuming my money in various ways: eating, traveling, playing, hobbying, cocooing. I know what that last word means. That's luxury, too. I'm educated and in the know.</p> 
    
    <p class = "leader">But I have no use for my knowledge. It's just another thing I've acquired, out of anything better to do. Everything is a hobby to me, even life itself. I have zero struggle.</p>

    <p class = "leader">I live in a country I was born into. I'm completely healthy and able bodied and of sound mind. There's nothing marginal about my identity, at least not in a way that would single me out or cause distress to me. Everything is and has always been easy to me.</p>
    
    <p class = "leader">It's no wonder social media seems pointless to people like me. What could we possibly have to say? Especially since for the last hundreds of years, people in my position have dominated everything. I am history. I am philosophy. I am science. I am art. I am stand-up.</p> 

    <p class = "leader">People who are unlike me, people who are marginalized, want to study and build on the things "I" have created. A rich man having no responsibilities, and nothing else to do but to think about his existence; these are the men, from Ancient Greek to contemporary thought, whose ideas you study in school.</p> 

    <p class = "leader">Why do you care about me? The answer to this falsely naive question, of course, is that you can not afford not to care about me. Whereas "I" can afford not to care about you.</p>

	<h2 class ="page-header">A is for <strike>Anarchy</strike> Agenda</h2>
	<p class = "lead">
	We made Nordic names to appear more white, more assimilated, more stylized like IKEA furniture tags. it was only natural this would be the next step to fame and excellence. We were tired of mediocrity and powerlessness of creating, then critiquing culture. Artists might as well be artisans or court jesters, or even better, digital prophets and trend forecasters. We needed a change of life Style. And this would be activated by an inaugural Scandinavian name change. Race and ethnicity are social construct anyway. It's the thought that counts. Even society is a social construct!</p>  
<br>
	<p class = "lead">Intellectuals call it "social capital", but we knew it was at best, a fine balance of showmanship and passion. Realizing we were failures at climbing the social ladder, we stayed up late reading guides on how to become sociopaths. We gave each other papercuts, stole from stores, lied and cheated to our loved ones and talked shit about our enemies. We knew whatever we were doing was going to be a drop in the ocean. This was is just one of a million emergencies–the quest for productive mediocrity. </p>
	
	Unaffected by war on home soil, the world now has to tolerate Y's millienial malaise. Entitled, overeducated, ambitious, competitive, ingrateful, idealistic, class-fluid, MacBook-touting imbeciles. Russian metro dogs on the run, sniffing our way through the city while taller humans looked on with disgust and amusement.</p>

<h2 class ="page-header">E for Experience </h2>
<p class = "lead">
     This is what we know: if a curator wants to work with you, they'll be active. You can smell forced  socializing from miles away. Meeting people is meaningless if there's no real desire from either party. Not that you couldn't get surprised by humans, in good and bad. And if you encounter the latter, maybe warn your closest friends? Yes, but only if you know what you're saying. Keep your gossip-to-info ratio in check. Colloquial tittle-tattle may be empowering, or entertaining at the very least. </p>

<h2 class ="page-header">W is for Why </h2>
<p class = "lead">
Rarely we do things for a good reason, but many are the times when we exercise obedience at the altar of conventions. Starry-eyed under a bleak, mute Nordic sky, waiting for rain when the forecast has been dead set on a permanent dry season for you and your yung peers. But another sun rises and we go to work, and we stick to the ideals picked up from MIT books when we were 19. Sometimes you have wine and you ask yourself if art means something anymore. Consider this: give fewer fucks about stuff that people with high power jobs in institutions imposed on you. You make it matter and it's your feet that can get you out of the hopeless artist talk. W is for Why</p> 

<p class = "lead">
"...the press believed and used to say I’m just “another” lousy fake. A highly untalented and a dull puppet of a girl that somehow managed to fuck her way up to the top. Being called “another”, feeling “another”… I remember being in a constant state of panic, the burden of proving yourself… and the limited time… and the unreasonable pressure, the desperate need to shake off that cloak of “anotherness”. First, you are the “other”, and then you are “another”. As if your “otherness” doesn’t kill you, your “anotherness” will. But I got lucky, I got through.</p>
